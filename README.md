# Nonlinear-SVM-Classification
Classification


**Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation and use of Nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. SVMs are a class of supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. Unlike linear SVMs, which find a linear decision boundary, nonlinear SVMs use kernel functions to find a decision boundary in a higher-dimensional space, making them powerful for handling complex data.

**Installation**
Python 3.6 or higher
Required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

**Usage**
**Data Preparation**
Ensure your data is in a suitable format, typically as a NumPy array or a Pandas DataFrame. The dataset should be split into features (X) and labels (y).
